PRIMAZE: Maze Generation & Maze Crawler Game
============================================

A 2D maze crawler game built in **Godot 3.0 Stable**, using external **procedural maze generation** tools. The project features a modular map gallery/loader system, support for AI pathfinding algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*), and flexible map import via JSON.

Maze generation is handled in a separate Python-based tool that exports maze data as JSON and screenshots, which are then loaded and played in this game project.

Features
--------
✅ Procedural maze generation (external tool)  
✅ JSON-based map import  
✅ Map gallery and loader system  
✅ AI pathfinding (BFS, DFS, A*)  
✅ Developed in **Godot 3.0 Stable**  
✅ Modular project structure  

How to Run
----------
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open the project in **Godot 3.0 Stable**.  
3. Import maze JSON files generated by your `PCG_Map_Algorithm` tool into the project’s map folder.  
4. Run the project to play through the loaded mazes.

How to Customize Export Directory
---------------------------------
1. Open `PCG_Maze/Main.gd`.  
2. Update the export directory path:  

```gdscript
const EXPORT_DIR = "YOUR/EXPORT/PATH/HERE"
```

Set this to your system’s export folder for generated maze maps.

Dependencies
------------
- **Godot 3.0 Stable**
